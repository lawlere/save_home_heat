				<h2>Ductless Air</h2>
				<p>A ductless air conditioner is a quiet, super-efficient system used to cool any part of your home or business.  An attractive indoor unit is mounted on an interior wall and cool air is distributed quietly.  A small, quiet condensing unit is located outside the house to generate the cooling.  The system is controlled from an easy to use remote control, or a wall mounted thermostat can be added instead. </p>

				<h2>Installation</h2>
				<p>In a master bedroom that's too warm.</p>
				<p>More efficient, two-stage systems will also help create more balanced cooling.</p>
				<p>In an office or den that's uncomfortable due to copiers, computers and other equipment.</p>
				<p>In any area with too much sun exposure.</p>
				<p>In homes with hot water heat that can't use a central AC system.</p>
				<p>In homes with central air conditioning where certain rooms aren't cooled effectively.</p>

				<p>When central air conditioning costs more to operate than you like.</p>
