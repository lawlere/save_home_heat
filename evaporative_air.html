				<h2>Evaporative Coolers</h2>
				<p>An evaporative cooler is a cost effective, environmentally friendly way to cool your home. The cooler is typically mounted on your roof and a large fan blows fresh, outdoor air that has been cooled and moistened into your home. Windows or doors are opened to direct the air through the home. Moist, fresh, cool!</p>

				<h2>Different than Central Air Conditioning</h2>
				<p>When you prefer fresh air with the doors and windows open rather than closed.</p>
				<p>When you prefer to add humidity to our typically dry summer air.</p>
				<p>When you want to have lower operating costs than a central air conditioner system.</p>
				<p>When you have central air conditioning but it doesn't work as well as you'd like.</p>

				<h2>It may not be for you if...</h2>
				<p>if you have allergies and want the doors and windows closed.</p>
				<p>If covenants prevent you from having one on your roof.</p>
				<p>If fan noise is not your cup of tea.</p>
				<p>If air grilles in your ceiling (that allow cold air to pass in the winter) are not visually appealing.</p>
				<p>If high indoor humidity levels are not desired.</p>
				<p>If less effective cooling on high humidity days is not acceptable.</p>
