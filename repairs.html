				<h2>Repairs</h2>
				<p>Our NATE certified technicians are trained to present you with complete information so you can make appropriate decisions when repairs are needed.   The decision of when to make repairs and when to replace a system is a delicate one, and we're confident you'll feel comfortable with the ethics of our technicians when handling that role.  Please call now and arrange for one of our friendly, skilled technicians to assess your needs.  We are very confident you will be pleased with our work.</p>

				<h2>Routine Maintenance and Maintenance Plans</h2>
				<p>Annual maintenance assures your equipment is operating effectively, reducing operating and repair costs, and extending equipment life.   To schedule maintenance you can call us when you need us, or better yet, become one of our many customers on a value-priced annual maintenance plan.  Maintenance plans offer multiple benefits.  We call you when your maintenance is due (it's easy to forget otherwise), we provide the service at a much lower price (since it helps balance our schedule), and if repairs are ever needed on covered equipment the work is done at discounted rates.  Please call now to set up your routine maintenance!</p>

				<h2>Ethics</h2>
				<p>Our goal, besides providing professional service, is to provide you with the information needed to make informed decisions.  When does it make sense to repair equipment?  When should you replace it?  Not every customer will make the same decision when presented the same set of facts.  We view our role as making sure you're provided with good information in a low pressure setting to make the decision that's best for you, while ensuring the safety of those living in the home along the way. </p>
