				<h2>Efficiency</h2>
				<p>Gas Efficiency: We offer furnace with gas efficiencies as high as a remarkable 98%! Older standard furnaces range from 60%-80% efficient.</p>
				<p>Electrical Efficiency: Furnace are available with super-efficient electronically commutated motors (ECM) or constant torque motors to drastically reduced the electrical operating cost.</p>
				<p>We have a broad selection of furnaces to satisfy your efficiency goals.</p>
				<a href="contact.html">Contact us for a free quote.</a>
				<h2>Quiet</h2>
				<p>Sealed combustion furnaces have closed burning chambers and doors with gaskets to isolate operating noise inside the furnace.</p>
				<p>Two-stage and modulating furnaces operate at reduced BTU and fan levels to minimize noise through the duct system.</p>
				<p>Electronically commutated motors can operate at very low fan speeds when you just want to circulate air. Many older furnaces were oversized, making them louder than necessary.</p>
				<p>Combine all these factors together and you may end up with a significantly quieter furnace!</p>
