				<h2>Efficiency</h2>
				<p>New air conditioners are much more efficient than older models. </p>
				<p>Energy savings of 20% - 65% are likely when you upgrade your system!</p>
				<p>We will properly size your new system.  Older systems were typically oversized, leading to short, inefficient operating cycles.</p>
				<p>Significant energy savings are available with an efficient, properly sized system.</p>

				<h2>Environmentally Friendly</h2>
				<p>New systems use more environmentally friendly R-410a refrigerant.</p>
				<p>New systems consume less energy making them better for the environment.</p>

				<h2>Reliable</h2>
				<p>New R-410a refrigerant systems will be repairable for years to come.  Old systems use R-22 refrigerant which is being phased out of production, making for costly future repairs.</p>
				<p>New air conditioners have a strong parts warranty (typically 5 or 10 years). </p>
				<p>New equipment improves resale value and makes your home more ‘sale ready’.</p>
				<p>A quiet outdoor unit relieves stress when you have neighbors close by.</p>
